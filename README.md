# Rome_Tour_Generator

**Project Domain**: Tourism

**Tools used**: Python and Tableau

**Type of Algorithms used**: Clustering (distance_matrix, KMeansConstrained)

**Project details**: 
- **Data Visualization**: I built a Dashboard in Tableau that proposes the users which locations to vist in Rome on each day of their stay. When accesing the Dashboard, the users must indicate the length of their stay. For each day, they will receive a proposal, indicating the attractions to visit, the kilometers to walk and the time that it may take (including walking time and time in the attraction).
- **Data Analysis**: The Dashboard works with data process in Python. I first uploaded a file containing the details of all the locations (latitude, longitude, etc). Then I processed it using Clustering Algorithms (like KMeans). 

**Programming Languages**: Python
